    <h1>Explore the Natural World</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to our journey through the magnificent landscapes and wildlife of our planet. From towering mountains to vast oceans, nature offers endless wonders that inspire and captivate us. This page celebrates the beauty and diversity of the natural world around us.</p>
    
    <h2>Majestic Mountains</h2>

    <p>Mountains have long been symbols of strength, endurance, and natural beauty. These geological giants shape our landscapes, influence weather patterns, and provide habitats for countless species. From the towering <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/himalayas" target="_blank">Himalayas</a> to the ancient <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/mountains/appalachian-mountains.htm" target="_blank">Appalachian Mountains</a>, each range tells a unique story of geological forces and time.</p>
    
    <h3>The Formation of Mountains</h3>
    
    <p>Mountain formation is a fascinating process that occurs over millions of years. Through tectonic plate movements, volcanic activity, and erosion, these natural monuments are carved from the Earth's crust. The <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-do-mountains-form" target="_blank">U.S. Geological Survey</a> provides detailed information about these incredible geological processes.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Did You Know?</strong> Mount Everest grows approximately 4 millimeters each year due to ongoing tectonic activity. This means the world's tallest peak is still growing!</p>
    
    <h2>Ocean Depths and Marine Life</h2>
    
    <img src="asset/marine.jpg" alt="Underwater coral reef with tropical fish" width="600" height="400">
    
    <p>The world's oceans cover more than 70% of our planet's surface and contain some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. From the sunlit surface waters to the mysterious depths of oceanic trenches, marine environments support an incredible array of life forms.</p>
    
    <h3>Coral Reef Ecosystems</h3>
    
    <p>Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on our planet, often called the "rainforests of the sea." These underwater gardens support approximately 25% of all marine species despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. Organizations like the <a href="https://coral.org/" target="_blank">Coral Restoration Foundation</a> work tirelessly to protect and restore these vital ecosystems.</p>
    
    <h2>Forest Sanctuaries</h2>
    
    <img src="asset/forest.jpg" alt="Sunlight streaming through tall forest trees" width="600" height="400">
    
    <p>Forests are the lungs of our planet, producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide while providing homes for countless species. These green sanctuaries range from tropical rainforests to temperate deciduous forests, each with its own unique characteristics and importance to global ecology.</p>
    
    <h3>The Amazon Rainforest</h3>
    
    <p>Often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth," the Amazon rainforest spans across nine countries and contains an estimated 390 billion trees. This incredible ecosystem is home to over 10% of the world's known species. Learn more about conservation efforts from the <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/amazon" target="_blank">World Wildlife Fund</a>.</p>
    
    <p><em>Forest Fact:</em> A single large tree can produce enough oxygen for two people for an entire day, while also absorbing 48 pounds of carbon dioxide annually.</p>
    
    <h2>Wildlife Conservation</h2>
    
    <img src="asset/wildlife.jpg" alt="Majestic elephant in natural habitat" width="600" height="400">
    
    <p>Protecting wildlife and their habitats is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance. Conservation efforts around the world work to preserve endangered species and restore damaged ecosystems. Every action we take can contribute to the preservation of our planet's incredible biodiversity.</p>
